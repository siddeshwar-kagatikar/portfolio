      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a Computer Science student with a strong interest in backend development
        and system design. I enjoy building scalable web applications and understanding
        how real-world systems work under the hood.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have hands-on experience with Spring Boot, React, and microservices
        architecture, and I like turning ideas into clean, working products.
