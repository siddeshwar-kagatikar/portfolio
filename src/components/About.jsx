      <p className="about-text">
        I’m a Computer Science student at IIIT Bangalore who enjoys building real-world software systems end to end — 
        from designing core logic to deploying production-ready applications. I like working across different domains and 
        learning how various pieces of a system come together.
      </p>

      <p className="about-text">
        I’ve worked on projects spanning distributed systems, machine learning, computer vision, and full-stack 
        development, and I enjoy applying these skills to solve practical problems at scale.
